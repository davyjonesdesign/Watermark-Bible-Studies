This is God’s way of intentionally reconstituting a segment of his people. It created and preserved a clear written record identifying the people who rebuilt and reestablished the Temple; so there could be no future claims that Persians or Samaritans rebuilt the temple or that any different use was intended for the Temple.

The journey is not described in scripture. The trip back to Jerusalem was just the beginning. Another journey, even harder, awaited them in Judah itself. Much had changed between the destruction of the Temple in 587 B.C. Remember that Nebuzaradan, general to Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian kin who conquered Judah, had led forces into Jerusalem and destroyed both the Temple and the city itself at length. All of the leaders, wealthy families, scribes, and best craftsmen were taken into exile. Many of the remaining people had already fled before the siege. Jeremiah 40 and 41 tell us that Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah, a Jew, as Babylonian governor of Judah. Gedaliah’s father was Ahikam, who had been an official in the court of King Josiah, and who had convinced a very angry King Jehoiakim not to turn over the prophet Jeremiah to be murdered by the people of Judah.

Question: Given these events, what conditions and challenges did Zerubbabel, the new governor, Jeshua the high priest, and the returned exiles face when they returned to Judah? Jerusalem is destroyed and abandoned, and the Temple has been obliterated. The region’s infrastructure, roads, wells, walls, grain store houses, forges, and threshing floors are overgrown and in disrepair. Whole villages are abandoned. After 50 years without leaders, priest, scribes, and prophets the few people remaining in Judah have forgotten the Law and how to keep it. In addition these remaining people would not greet the returning exiles with open arms (remember Naomi’s return to Bethlehem in Ruth). They would have begrudged sharing the land, the slim harvest, and dwindling flocks.

Fields are uncultivated, and grain stores are few. What will they eat for the first year? Samaritans, Ammonites, Idumeans, Philistines, Egyptians, and other regional peoples would have drifted into the boundaries of Judah and laid claim to land, shelter, and fields. Many of the returning exiles were urban dwellers in Persia. The new life would have been very, very hard. The first report upon the return to Judah is about giving and location.

They build an altar to offer burnt offerings according to the Law of Moses, on the site of the ruined Temple. This act was greeted with hostility and opposition by people who were in the land, Jew and Gentile, when the exiles returned. Verse 3 tells us that fear was on the exiles “because of the peoples of the lands.” This means that the exiles were enormously uncomfortable in reestablishing the Law as prescribed by God and Moses, but were determined to do so.

They ceased work on the temple beginning in 536 B.C. and it is now 520 B.C. At the beginning of chapter 5 we see that the returned exiles have drifted from their original purpose in rebuilding the temple. Cyrus the Great died in 530 B.C. His son, Cambyses II, ruled from 530 B.C. until 522 B.C. Cambyses II died under disputed circumstances, and he was succeeded by Bardiya, who was either a younger son of Cyrus the Great or an impostor who was murdered shortly after assuming the throne. Darius the Great, who will rule from 522 B.C. until 486 B.C., is now the king. At the beginning of chapter 5 we read that God moved his prophets, Haggai and Zechariah to prophesy. Here is what Haggai, in Haggai, chapter 1, said. Question: In Haggai God is speaking directly to the chosen exiles he stirred and caused to return to Judah. What is his focus? ““In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest: (2) “Thus says the LORD of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD.” (3) Then the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, (4) “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? (5) Now, therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways. (6) You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes. (7) “Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways. (8) Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the LORD. (9) You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. (10) Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. (11) And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors.” (12) Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people feared the LORD. (13) Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke to the people with the LORD's message, “I am with you, declares the LORD.” (14) And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, (15) on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.”” God acknowledges that people, including many of the exiles, are saying that it’s not time to rebuild the temple and have used this excuse for 16 years. He convicts the exiles of using the time, labor, and materials meant for the temple to build lavish “paneled houses” for themselves, selfishly using the cedars from Lebanon to line their dwellings. God reveals the restless hearts and souls of a people who have turned to themselves and away from God. They‘ve been busy but have accomplished very little. Nothing makes them happy; not food or drink, or clothes. Their disobedience has left them cold. God has not been able to bless the returned exiles because they have been steadfast in their disobedience. God has dried up the rain that sustains the soil, and all the essential harvests have diminished. The words of Haggai and Zechariah, God’s prophets, are effective and convicting. Verse 13 tells us that the returned exiles heard, obeyed, and rekindled their respect for God. Not only does God share clear words of revelation, conviction, and instruction, and he acts affirmatively to again stir the exiles (v. 14) to resume reconstruction of the temple. Contrast this inertia and disobedience with Esther, who also faced uncertain and threatening circumstances, and resolute enemies; but chose to obey God as best she could. When she made her choice to obey, regardless of cost, God blessed her actions. Psalm 119: 129 & 130, reminds us of the powerful guidance, positive support, conviction, wisdom, and revelation that God’s word brings to our lives: ““Your testimonies are wonderful; therefore my soul keeps them. (130) The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple.”” James 1:22-25 says: ““(22) But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. (23) For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. (24) For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. (25) But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.”” This is the expression of faith in response to God’s word. Psalm 51 tells us that the sacrifices that God values most are a broken spirit, and a broken and contrite heart. This is where real faith begins, in the absolute recognition that it is only through God that we have life and purpose. When we approach God this way he draws near to us. God’s word is effective. Ezra 5:2 tells us that Zerubbabel and Jeshua are inspired and begin to rebuild the temple. This renewal of effort brings official inquiry from the presiding governor of the province, Tattenai, and Shetharbozenai, who may have been Tattenai’s chief advisor, and other provincial administrators. They don’t oppose the construction in the same way Samaritan administrators did in the letter shared in chapter 4, but they want confirmation that the rebuilding of the temple has the king’s approval. Question: How is this different from challenge shared in chapter 4? The returned exiles don’t stop working. Tattenai is more inquiring than opposing. There is a reason for this. Verses 4 & 5 tell us:““(4) They[a] also asked them this: “What are the names of the men who are building this building?” (5) But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report should reach Darius and then an answer be returned by letter concerning it.””God’s intersession restrains Tattenai and grants the returned exiles the courage to continue. We even see God’s strong hand in the correspondence to Darius the Great; in verses 11-17. The letter that Tattenai and his administrators write is a thing of beauty. It is an official inquiry, written in Aramaic, the official administrative language of the Persian Empire; but within its text the returned Jewish exiles bear testimony to who they are, the origin of the temple, the nature of the God they worship, their history of disobedience, God’s plan, and Cyrus the Great’s role, and his acknowledgement of the very God for whom the temple is being reconstructed. We even get details confirming that the returned exiles are the builders and the approach they are taking to accomplish the rebuilding. We also see, through the eyes of nonbelievers, the renewed faith and commitment of the returned exiles. They are accomplishing God’s purpose in rebuilding the temple, Plus the letter asks for confirmation of the original decree from Cyrus the Great, giving double confirmation, at different points in time, to the original edict. The edict that God inspired.At the beginning of chapter 6:1-12, we see that Tattenai’s letter launches a full search of the royal archives. The search expands from Babylonia proper, and travels east to the region of Media and the city of Ecbatana, which served as the summer residence of the Persian kings, starting with Cyrus the Great. In Ecbatana they find a copy of the edict issued nine years and three kings earlier. Darius’ response is electrifying. Question: How does Darius support the rebuilding of the temple? First the original decree from Cyrus the Great is restated. Remember that God stirred Cyrus to write this decree and it seems that Darius is also stirred by God once he reads it. Darius’ first command in verse 6 is for Tattanai and all of his officials to stay away from the Jews and not interfere with the rebuilding of the temple; and to permit the local Jewish govern, Zerubbabel, and the Jewish elders to rebuild the temple on its original site. Because of this instruction from the king there can be no subsequent claim that the Persians or Samaritans assisted in or oversaw the reconstruction, or that the temple was moved from its original location. The true record is established by God, through Darius, in the Book of Ezra. All expenses and any materials needed are to be supplied by the treasury of the Province Beyond the River. The provincial rulers could not claim that funding needed to come from Babylonia proper. Any revision of Darius’ edict was punishable by death; discouraging the sort of sustained lobbying we saw with the letter in chapter 4. Darius concludes by asking that God punish and overthrow any king, official, or person who seeks to overturn the edict or interfere with the reconstruction of the temple. Through Haggai God speaks to the doubts, emotions, and fears of the returned exiles: ““(3)Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes? (4) Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the LORD. Be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the LORD. Work, for I am with you, declares the LORD of hosts, (5) according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt.

(8) The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the LORD of hosts. (9) The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, declares the LORD of hosts.”” As the Jews rebuild in a stark landscape God shares a far greater promise: the coming downfall of Persia to Alexander the Great, and the arrival of his own son,Christ Jesus at the temple gate to bring peace and salvation to the world. Book Of Ezra: God’s Unbroken Circle; The Rise Of Ezra. Finally, on March 12, of 516 B.C. the rebuilding of the temple was completed; approximately 70 years after Nebuchadnezzar ordered its complete destruction in 586 B.C; and 21 years after Zerubbabel and Jeshua led the exiles back to Jerusalem and first laid the temple foundation.

Question: How do the exiles celebrate the reconstruction of the temple? Keep in mind the profound importance of this moment.

They handled the special vessels in the temple and guarded the temple treasury. They also served as judges. They did not act as priests. Ezra needed them in order to ensure that the temple was running as God intended. Apparently God has placed on Ezra’s heart a concern that the last exiles who returned to  Judah and Jerusalem are not being faithful in their actions. We will see that Ezra is exactly right in chapter 9. Ezra sends a delegation to a place called Casiphia (meaning ‘silvermith’), perhaps a location where Levites lived in Babylon. Ezra instructs the delegation to speak to the head of the Levites, a man named Iddo. 38 Levites and 220 temple slaves agree to go with Ezra. Ezra recognizes who made this possible. In verse 18 he says,',\n        quote: 'And by the good hand of our God on us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen…'\n      },\n      {\n        item: 'We need to continuously pause and worship God and seek his guidance as we work; and especially in challenging and hectic times.

Ezra sets a greater example for everyone.'\n      }\n    ],\n    content: \"In chapter 7 we leap ahead almost 58 years, to the seventh year of the reign of King Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes. God describes Ezra with care at the beginning of chapter 7. Question: What do we learn about Ezra? First he is a priest from a family of priests descended directly from Aaron. He came out of the city of Babylon, which, according to F. Charles Fensham (The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, Eerdmans, 1982, p. 98) was where the majority of Jews, still living in exile, were located. Nehemiah came out of Susa, home city to Esther and Mordecai. In verse 7 Ezra is described as a secretary or teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, meaning he has appointed authority from Artaxerxes, and is one of the keepers of the Law of Moses, as God had given it. This means that Ezra has a special anointing from God. Ezra and those like him are essential to reestablishing the observance of the Law as God had originally prescribed through Moses. Fensham describes ‘secretary’ as a specifically Persian office; granting Ezra secular power. We also learn, most importantly, that the hand of God is on Ezra, and because of this Ezra had the full favor and confidence of the king, and the king’s advisors. Ezra led a contingent of exiles to Jerusalem, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants. These are people clearly intended to strengthen the work of the temple in the community that is now reviving and rising in Judah. Again in verse 9 we read that the gracious hand of God was on Ezra, because of Ezra’s own faith in and devotion to God. In verse 10 we read that even in exile, Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law, and taught it to the exile community. Ezra is God’s man, and is committed in faith to God in the way that Moses had commanded of Israel with such direct urgency in Deuteronomy 30: 9-18. “The LORD will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as he delighted in your ancestors, (10) if you obey the LORD your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. (11) Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. (12) It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, “Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?” (13) Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, “Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?” (14) No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it. (15) See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction. (16) For I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in obedience to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess. (17) But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them, (18) I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.””  Ezra’s faithfulness and obedience demonstrate to us what the faith of one person can accomplish. God wants us to see and know this, and live this way. Artaxerxes armed Ezra with powers and a specific mission in a remarkable letter, the text of which is fully captured in chapter 7. Ezra must have asked Artaxerxes for the grant and authority captured in this letter. Question: What does the letter provide? The letter is written in Aramaic, the administrative language of the Persian Empire. In verse 13 Artaxerxes allows other exiles, including priests and Levites, who volunteer, to go with Ezra to Jerusalem. Ezra wants only those who feel led by God to go with him. Ezra is authorized to assess whether the Law of God is being obeyed in the region of Judah and the city of Jerusalem. This fits with Ezra’s mission to teach the Law, and right obedience to the Law, and the stories that he must have heard about Samaritan and other dangerous influences in the region. Ezra is authorized to take the funding he receives to provide specifically for the worship needs of the temple. It is important to know that Ezra’s grant of authority, see verse 21, is given to him as “the priest” and “the teacher of the Law of God of heaven.” Ezra has a different kind of power and authority as the king’s secretary, but chooses to stand on his identity as God’s man in accomplishing his purposes. All of his financial dealings and requests for additional funding are focused with laser-like specificity on the needs of the temple and the temple staff. Ezra asks nothing for himself in terms of wealth, housing, material comfort, or political authority. In verse 19 Artaxerxes entrusts Ezra with the remaining temple artifacts not already returned by Zerubbabel; and in verse 24 we see Artaxerxes wise view and partial understanding of who God is. He says ‘give the God of heaven what he requires and let his temple be honored as God instructs. I don’t want this God to be angry with me or my household.’ In verse 25 Artaxerxes provides a remarkable grant of power in response to what must have been a very bold request from Ezra. He gives Ezra the power to appoint, in the king’s name, magistrates and judges to administer justice to “all who know the laws of your God,” meaning returned exiles and others who remained in Judah and kept the law. Further, Ezra is given power to teach the laws of God to “any who do not know them.” Clearly God’s hand is on Ezra and on Artaxerxes in the granting of this request. It’s openhanded wisdom, mercy, seeking of the welfare of others, and care bears God’s own character. In verse 26 Artaxerxes identifies the law of God with his own law as king. Ezra is granted the right to enforce both, and is given the power to impose death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment as punishments for disobedience. Ezra’s response in verses 27 & 28 is wonderful instruction for us today. He does not glory in his new powers or worry about the challenges. He praises God for influencing Artaxerxes to bring honor to God’s house in Jerusalem, and for granting his divine favor to Ezra. Ezra is wise and selfless. He says that because God is with him, and only because God is with him, he has the courage to gather other exiled leaders to go with him to Jerusalem. Ezra knows that God is the source of all he is, has, and may do. Chapter 8: Journey, Example, and Challenge. The assembly of exiles returning to Jerusalem is much smaller this time.

Question: What is God trying to accomplish by changing the voice of this narrative to first person? Faith begins with the personal and individual, the relationship between one person and God. God lets us see inside of this relationship with Ezra, which is important, because that is where we begin every day. Ezra becomes us rather than a distant historical figure. Faith has a strong emotional component. We hate to admit fear, or shame, or weakness, or doubt, or anger, but this is part of the faith journey. God always knows the worst about us and still loves us; and can still use us in his work if we look to him. At the beginning of chapter 8 we are again presented with a genealogy of those who returned.

There is a much greater focus on the journey itself. It took four months for them to cover the 900 miles. Question: What do we learn from Ezra’s journey that helps us on our own faith walk? It takes courage and God gives us that courage; and we should both acknowledge this and lean on it. At the end of chapter 7, Ezra says that “Because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.” Ezra knew it would not be easy to convince people to go with him but that God would make it possible, by stirring the hearts of those he wanted to make the journey.

After he weights out and accounts for the 25 tons of precious artifacts, gold, and silver he entrusts the priests to guard it with these words beginning in verse 28, ““You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers. (29) Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the LORD.” (30) So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.”” Ezra mirrors God’s own view and so should we.

In Zephaniah 3:17 he wrote, ““The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.”” Ezra is consistent in demonstrating faithfulness. It’s not a one-time thing. When they arrive in Jerusalem four month later they take three days to rest and reflect on how the hand of God was on them for the entire 900 mile trip and protected them “from enemies and bandits along the way.”(v. 31). Ezra seeks no personal gain for himself and demonstrates his own trustworthiness. When he arrives in Jerusalem he again weighs out the large treasure of silver, gold, and valuable artifacts to demonstrate that it is all there and accounted for. Ezra honors the commitments he has made to others, even to a pagan king like Artaxerxes.

More than 100 religious and civil leaders, including priests and Levites working in the temple itself, had made the decision to intermarry with all the pagan peoples around them, including the descendants of the original corrupt Canaanite populations in the Promised Land; so have other prominent men among the returned exile families. God’s Law as shared with Moses specifically prohibited this. As we learned in Ruth, a foreign woman may marry a Jewish man if she is not a descendant of the Canaanites and if she adopts the Jewish faith. These pagan peoples, described in chapter 9   shared the same worship practices identified in 2 Kings 17:24-40, which  described the corrupted religious practices of the new inhabitants of Samaria in the north. Remember, the first exiles returned in 537 B.C and Ezra’s return was in 458 B.C.; so this practice of intermarrying with pagan cultures has been forming and under way for more than 70 years. What is also interesting is that we do not learn who the leaders were who revealed this sinful practice.

Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers? Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.”   God himself was appalled and grief stricken by the careless disregard of the returned exiles.

Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. (Leviticus 11:44 and 1 Peter 1:16). Ezra prepared himself through prayer, worship, and engagement with his community of faith. God will do the same with us.

Ezra’s final line in verse 15 was a humbling, eye-opening indictment,  “Here we are before you in guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.”  Ezra acknowledged what we all need to acknowledge: we are at risk, always, in straying if we are not vigilant in staying close to God.

Ezra has a special task in returning. He arrives after the temple is rebuilt and before the walls of Jerusalem are raised again. He has a different assignment: to rebuild the identity of God’s people as God intended them to be. In returning Ezra has been a good steward. He brought out the entire treasure he transported from Babylon and had it counted and weighed before the priests of the temple to ensure that it was all there, and none had been taken for personal gain. He offered sacrifice to God at the temple to publicly thank God, remind the exiles as to why they had returned, and to reestablish the Law. He shared his letter from Artaxerxes with all the governing administrators and leaders in Trans-Euphrates so that they would begin their required work in supporting the temple and the exiles.t wa Is probably as Ezra was making the rounds to the officials in Trans-Euphrates, and sharing his letter, that certain leaders, referenced in 9:1, spoke with Ezra about the growing problem of intermarriage between the returned exiles and the descendants of the Canaanite peoples. More than 100 religious and civil leaders, including priests and Levites working in the temple itself, had made the decision to intermarry with all the pagan peoples around them, including the descendants of the original corrupt Canaanite populations in the Promised Land; so have other prominent men among the returned exile families. God’s Law as shared with Moses specifically prohibited this. As we learned in Ruth, a foreign woman may marry a Jewish man if she is not a descendant of the Canaanites and if she adopts the Jewish faith. These pagan peoples, described in chapter 9 shared the same worship practices identified in 2 Kings 17:24-40, which described the corrupted religious practices of the new inhabitants of Samaria in the north. Remember, the first exiles returned in 537 B.C and Ezra’s return was in 458 B.C.; so this practice of intermarrying with pagan cultures has been forming and under way for more than 70 years. What is also interesting is that we do not learn who the leaders were who revealed this sinful practice. They may have been seeking political advantage by informing, we don’t know, but God used it to good purpose. When Ezra learned of the intermarriage problem, his reaction was exemplary and decisive. Question: Why is this important to us? Ezra tore his tunic and his cloak, both his outer garment and the garment underneath, pulled hair from his head and beard, and sat down where he was. This was an understood demonstration of mourning, loss, and humility. Jews, pagans, and Persians alike would have understood the display. Ezra sat on the ground in public looking completely appalled until 3:00 p.m., which was evening sacrifice; even as crowds gathered around him. Ezra’s own emotions and conviction were so strong that those who shared his conviction (“everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathering around me…”) were drawn to him and kept public vigil with him through the afternoon. Ezra’s grief, mourning, anger, and despair were public and unashamed; much as Mordecai’s display of sackcloth and ashes in Esther, chapter 4. It has been clearly established that Ezra in this case was God’s emissary and ambassador. His emotional reaction reflected God’s own reaction to what the exiles had done. God spoke to this through Malachi, the last of the Old Testament prophets who wrote around the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. Malachi 2:10 & 11 says, “Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers? Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.” God himself was appalled and grief stricken by the careless disregard of the returned exiles. Like Xerxes some of the returned exiles had chosen to indulge themselves rather than keeping faith with God. This problem had been going on for a long while; but it was not until Ezra’s public display of rage, grief and abasement that the returned exile community started to recognize that something was wrong, and questioned its behavior. God had invested in Ezra, backed Ezra, trusted Ezra, and moved Ezra 900 miles to accomplish this recognition, and remind the exiles that they were still God’s chosen people with a specific identity, an accountability to the Law, and a calling from God himself, For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy. (Leviticus 11:44 and 1 Peter 1:16). Ezra prepared himself through prayer, worship, and engagement with his community of faith. God will do the same with us. He prepares us and calls on us to convey his views on problems, issues, and disputes in the world, to support one another and remind one another of who we are, what our calling is, and our distinct identity as part of the royal priesthood, the chosen people, the holy nation of the redeemed, the family of God, that God has saved and blessed through Christ. In Ezra 9:6-15, Ezra raised a long prayer to God. Question: What stands out to you about this prayer? What do we learn about our own walk with Christ? First Ezra prayed in public. This prayer was shared with his fellow exiles who had been looking the other way when it came to addressing the issue of intermarriage. Ezra acknowledged his own shame and disgrace. Even though this particular sin was not his, he recognized that he too was imperfect, a sinner, and shared both the burden and the accountability. He recognized that the propensity to sin, which caused this problem, was longstanding, “From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great,” and didn’t try to paint a better picture of history. Ezra was praying for a nation, not just for himself. In verse 9 Ezra acknowledged that God has shown Israel a great kindness, he had permitted them favor with the Persian kings, he had granted them a new life in returning to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple, and had protected them despite all of the challenges and energetic enemies devoted to thwarting their progress. Ezra acknowledged that despite God’s clear and generous display of mercy, despite the keeping of promise and prophecy in the rebuilding of the temple, despite God’s clear instruction and admonition that the people of Israel were not to intermarry with the Canaanites, the people persisted in flagrant disobedience. Ezra went back to scripture to frame this, Deuteronomy chapter 7. Ezra used God’s own commands, commands the Israelites promised to keep, in condemning present behavior. Ezra’s final line in verse 15 was a humbling, eye-opening indictment, “Here we are before you in guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence.” Ezra acknowledged what we all need to acknowledge: we are at risk, always, in straying if we are not vigilant in staying close to God. And we will stray. When we do, we need to acknowledge it, confess it, repent, and ask for forgiveness. It was only because Ezra had the courage to pray this prayer, and issued this call to acknowledge sin and to repentance, that subsequent revival took place. We much also recognize that in this moment not everyone was happy with Ezra. There had to be a significant number of returned exile leaders, especially those who have intermarried, who were initially furious at Ezra for bringing this up. As Ezra remarked at the end of chapter 7 it is God who supplies the courage in these moments of risk and difficulty. In chapter 10 we see the effect of Ezra’s prayer. Question: What is the response to Ezra’s prayer? A large crowd of Israelites, men, women, and children, gathered around Ezra as he prays. They too were affected by Ezra’s prayer and godly emotion. They too wept bitterly. One man stepped forward, Shecaniah, who was willing to act. He too acknowledged the sin, and said that there was still hope. He called on everyone to make a covenant before God to end the inappropriate marriages, to submit to the counsel of Ezra and those others who understand and follow the Law, and then to send away the foreign women and children concerned. Ezra was called by God to continue in prayer. He placed the priests and the Levites under oath to carry out Shecaniah’s instructions and then he went to a private room to continue in fasting and praying. Remember that Ezra was given great authority by Artaxerxes to administer punishment by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment. Ezra did not rely primarily on this authority to punish and enforce, but on the authority of God. On December 19th all of the elders assembled in Jerusalem in the midst of a driving rain. They confessed their wrongdoing and agree to submit to investigation and final decision by the designated officials who would act for the entire returned exile community.The investigation took about three months, and then the men affected, who needed to end inappropriate marriages were carefully named at the end of the Book of Ezra, so that there could be no confusion as to where the problem lay, and no whispering campaign against others simply to seek retribution or gain political advantage. Revival occurred here in the sense that there was a community-wide recognition of sin, the need to repent, and the need for action to end the inappropriate behavior. There was no sense of rejoicing here because this was not an easy moment. Lives were affected and hard decisions were made. For the foreign women and children affected there were two possible outcomes: (1) return to their households of origin, or (2) convert to Judaism and remain in Judah, supported by the hospitality required under the Law. As Christians this reminds us of Paul’s own words in Philippians 2, beginning in verse 12: “(12) Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, (13) for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. (14) Do all things without grumbling or disputing, (15) that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, (16) holding fast to the word of life…” We are called on to live and act like Christ, and to be the light of the world.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 6,\n    date: '2016-04-03',\n    path: 'intro',\n    title: 'introduction',\n    book: 'Nehemiah',\n    label: 'Nehemiah',\n    verse: 'Nehemiah',\n    chapterFrom: '',\n    verseFrom: '',\n    chapterTo: '',\n    verseTo: '',\n    image: 'https://davyjonesdesign.github.io/data-for-axios/assets/wmstudies/nehemiah.jpg',\n    paragraph1: 'Nehemiah was the third returning exile.

Charles Fensham (The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, p. 179) that in the Hebrew Bible the first 23 verses of chapter four are a continuation of chapter three, making the reaction of Nehemiah’s enemies more directly tied to the rebuilding of the wall. When Sanballat, governor of Trans-Eurphrates, hears that Nehemiah has begun reconstruction of the Jerusalem wall his anger explodes. Question: Sanballat’s reaction is the same reaction we often face as Christ’s church today. What is it? Beginning in verse four we see Nehemiah’s own reaction, which is important for us to understand. How does Nehemiah respond? Sanballat goes back to the first approach he used in Nehemiah 3:10, mockery and scorn, because these are so powerful. And, in verse two he makes this mockery a public and broad undertaking by doing it in front of his fellow administrators and the Samaritan army, which is the militia based defensive force for the province. He knows that all these people are connected by kinship, friendship, and business relationships with the various Jewish families helping to rebuild the wall. Some of these Jewish families are also engaged in undermining the reconstruction. Sanballat is using the ancient version of publicity. Sanballat attacks the Jews personally, calling them feeble. He attacks their project: “Will they restore their wall?” He attacks their God as ineffective: “Will they offer sacrifices?” He exaggerates and ridicules their ambitions: “Will they finish in a day?” He observes that the rubble is insufficient to build anything; knowing that all this will get back to the Jews. Sanballat’s toady, Tobiah the Ammonite, “who was at his side” joins in the mockery: “What they are building –even if a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!” So Sanballat uses public mockery, personal attack, distortion of facts, and appeals to sympathetic audiences as his primary instruments to derail work on the wall. All of these attacks come directly to Nehemiah. Nehemiah must have had a steady stream of people approaching him each day, and saying “guess what I heard?” And other people saying, “this task is impossible,” or “let’s wait for a better moment.” Nehemiah must have felt some anger, disappointment, and increasing impatience. He probably wanted to lash out, and hurl counter insults at Sanballat and his cronies; but his first decision was to pray to God. This choice is a life choice for Nehemiah. It was prayer and reliance on God that got him to Jerusalem, an no matter who he feels he will place God at the center. We should too. Jeremiah 29:13 says, “ You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.” We see that Nehemiah, with God’s help, has made this part of his faith walk with God. This orientation means that Nehemiah doesn’t put himself first. His petition begins with the recognition that it is God himself and the Jews who are being mocked. His request is that God hold the Samaritans and their allies accountable for their mockery. Nehemiah trusts God’s hand to administer justice, not his own. He may have been remembering Psalms 1 which says: “Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; (2) but his delight is in the law[b] of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. (3) He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. (4) The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away. (5) Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; (6) for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.” In the next verse, verse 6, Nehemiah tells us that after the onset of this campaign of jeering and mockery the Israelites were able to rebuild the wall to half its height, because “the people worked with all their heart.” This is a direct message to us, telling us to follow Nehemiah’s blue print. When under attack, when mocked, when subject to slander and distortion, turn first to Christ and God and seek their intervention and justice; let Christ define your behavior, your action, and your well-being. This approach enables us to endure the greatest stress, storms, and opposition. Nehemiah’s faithfulness does not end the conflict. When Sanballat hears that the work continues, he ratchets up the pressure and opposition. Verse seven tells us that when he hears that the repairs have gone ahead, he rallies opposition from all quarters: The Ammonites to the east, the Arabs to the south, the men of Ashdod to the west, and the Samaritans to the north. Judah was cut off. Not only was Judah surrounded by hostile camps, but Sanballat and his confederates also threatened an attack on Jerusalem itself. The stakes are higher. Nehemiah’s response to this is to have the people joined in continual prayer to God, and to post a guard day and night. This is a sober and wise response. The first emphasis is on prayer, the second on action guided by that prayer. As Nehemiah leads his people in a time of great challenge and opposition he is also setting an example that is direct testimony as to what it means to belong to God, and to exemplify God’s character, the sort of example that Paul identified in Colossians 4: “(2) Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. (3) At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison— (4) that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. (5) Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. (6) Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.” Also Ephesian 6:18, “And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.” The next challenge is the hardest one of all, and that is internal discouragement. This is very much a common challenge for us as well, and enormously important for us to understand. Question: In what ways do the Israelites demonstrate discouragement? What do we learn from this and what is Nehemiah’s reaction? First, in verse 10, there is a general murmuring across the entire province of Judah that the workers in Jerusalem are giving out, and the rubble is too vast to clear away. In other words the task is impossible there aren’t enough people to do it, and we are failing. The scripture’s sense is that these sentiments were repeated over and over again. Then the Jews living close to the borders to Judah, abutting the regions where the opposition lived, kept coming to Jerusalem and warning Nehemiah and his workers that they would be attacked and killed at any time. In verse 12 Nehemiah describes this as being told “ten times over….” Remember that this wide spread fear, anxiety, forecasting of failure and disaster, and naysaying was going on at the same time Nehemiah was praying to God himself, and had his workers praying to God around the clock. So what we learn is that even as we seek faithful and prayerful purpose, there will be doubt, fear, confusion, and anxiety about where things are headed. This should be expected and not cause us to waiver if we have prayerfully sought God’s guidance. Nehemiah addressed this in several ways. First he stationed armed guards along the wall where everyone could see them. Then Nehemiah encouraged everyone: Nehemiah used encouragement rather than criticism. He invoked God rather than his own authority, and he reminded the Israelites that they shared a common identity in God, and so had a divine and sacred accountability to fight for one another. These verses remind us of Christ’s own words concerning fear in Matthew 10, beginning in verse 26. We are not to fear those who seek our harm or to intimidate; rather we are to fear only God who has the power of life and death and the power to save or condemn our very souls. For us fear of the Lord begins with an understanding of his love and compassion and protection; his great regard for us. If we believe in Christ as the Son of God, then God will never be separated from us, regardless of peril: “(26) So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. (27) What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. (28) And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. (29) Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. (30) But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. (31) Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (32) So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, (33) but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.” Nehemiah had these words from Isaiah 41 which may have convicted him and certainly gave him profound guidance and comfort: “But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend; (9) you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, “You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off”; (10) fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

(12) You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all.

Warren Wiersbe (Be Determined:  Nehemiah, David Cook, 2009, eBook)   writes,',\n    quote1: 'Selfishness means putting myself at the center of everything and insisting on getting what I want when I want it.

Here is an extremely important point for us to remember. Because Nehemiah submits his feelings to God he is able to exercise a greater influence in solving the contentious problems that confront him. Proverbs 16: 3,6-8, & 32 say,',\n        quote: \"(3) Commit your work to the LORD, and your plans will be established…(6) By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the LORD one turns away from evil.

In chapter 5 he undercovers both a foundational distress and a monstrous selfishness that threatens to undermine everything. Warren Wiersbe (Be Determined: Nehemiah, David Cook, 2009, eBook) writes, “Selfishness means putting myself at the center of everything and insisting on getting what I want when I want it. It means exploiting others so I can be happy and taking advantage of them just so I can have my own way. It is not only wanting my own way, but expecting everybody else to want my way too. Why are selfish people so miserable? I think Thomas Merton said it best: “To consider persons and events and situations only in the light of their effect upon myself is to live on the doorstep of hell.” Verse 1 tells us that the people are in serious trouble and deeply divided with fellow Jews who are taking advantage of difficult circumstances. There are several urgent problems. First there isn’t enough to eat. Labor demands for rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and maintaining security meant that farmers and vineyard workers did not have time to keep up the surrounding agricultural fields and vineyards, lessening the harvest and making Judah more vulnerable to famine. Sanballat had also cut off most of the trade routes in and out of Judah so there was no consistent way to export goods and import grain. The families that had returned from exile had also grown in size and there were more mouths to feed. Second those who had property had to mortgage fields, vineyards, and houses in order to pay for grain. Third, they still had to pay the ground tax to their Persian overlords. Darius levied an ongoing tax on all fields and vineyards that produced a crop. Fourth, children of the debtors, and those who were hungry, were being forced into servitude, slavery, by their creditors; a servitude that did not end until the debt was paid. In this case the creditors were fellow Jews who had money; Jews that Nehemiah described as ‘nobles and officials’. We may presume from what follows that these same wealthy Jews were the mortgage holders for the farmers and other landowners who have had to mortgage their fields, vineyards, and houses. In verse 5 the people complain that they are helpless as their sons and daughters are forced into service, and in some cases their daughters become second wives to wealthy Jews. They have also lost ownership of their fields and vineyards. This practice is loathsome to God and against Jewish Law. Jewish law provides that every seven years all hired servants are required to be released in order to avoid the creation of a ‘slave’ class of Jews. Question: What is Nehemiah’s reaction to this and what do we learn? He is furious but slow to anger. In verse 6 Nehemiah tells us that he is very angry, but he doesn’t give in to this. Verse 7 tells us that he “took counsel of himself” meaning that he took time to pray and reflect before acting. This process of prayer and reflection is consistent for Nehemiah throughout his account. It’s a behavior he leans on and models for everyone else around him. Here is an extremely important point for us to remember. Because Nehemiah submits his feelings to God he is able to exercise a greater influence in solving the contentious problems that confront him. Proverbs 16: 3,6-8, & 32 say, “(3) Commit your work to the LORD, and your plans will be established…(6) By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the LORD one turns away from evil. (7) When a man's ways please the LORD, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. (8) Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice…(32) Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.” Nehemiah is fearless but modest in diagnosing the problems, taking on the most powerful members of the exile community and indicting them,  “You are exacting interest, each from his brother.” He speaks plainly and doesn’t exaggerate. It may have been that he met with them privately first and they did not respond. Then, like Ezra, he realized that resolution needed to be accomplished in the open, in a moment shared by the entire returned exile community. This took great courage and selflessness for Nehemiah. He was putting his own power and authority at risk by doing this. In this large open meeting Nehemiah addressed the offenders who would have been arrayed in positions of favor closest to Nehemiah. Nehemiah told them that all the Jews, working together, had striven to buy back other Jews who were held in servitude by the Samaritans, Arabs, Ammonites, and the men of Ashdod to the east, all the surrounding pagan nations; only to have them resold into slavery by their own people. In doing this Nehemiah appealed to unity, repeatedly using the words “brother” or “brothers. The nobles and the officials were stunned and silenced by this, “and could not find a work to say.” Their silence was their first public admission of guilt. Nehemiah had more to say. From this specific accusation he moved on to appeal to a larger purpose. As he looked at the nobles and officials, and then out across the great crowd he had assembled he said, “The thing you are doing is not good. Ought you not walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations of our enemies?” What does it mean to walk in the fear of the Lord? It is an attitude of respect, reverence, wonder, awe, gratefulness toward God; and an understanding of his majestic power, depthless mercy and love, and perfect nature, which we are to worship, pursue, and exemplify. Psalm 111 captures this perfectly: “Praise the LORD! I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart, in the company of the upright, in the congregation. (2) Great are the works of the LORD, studied by all who delight in them. (3) Full of splendor and majesty is his work, and his righteousness endures forever. (4) He has caused his wondrous works to be remembered; the LORD is gracious and merciful. (5) He provides food for those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever. (6) He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them the inheritance of the nations. (7) The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy; (8) they are established forever and ever, to be performed with faithfulness and uprightness. (9) He sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant forever. Holy and awesome is his name! (10) The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all those who practice it have a good understanding. His praise endures forever!” Nehemiah shares a vision of God and faithfulness that all of Israel, and we today, should aspire to. It is unifying, inspiring, and elevating. It states our true and intended identity as God’s children and emissaries. To step away from this, to turn away from God, and behave with corrupt self-interest means that Judah is no better that the surrounding pagan nations and deserves the taunts that chase hypocrisy. Nehemiah’s charge was ‘be better than this’; to be God’s people, in both thought and act. Again, Nehemiah did not appeal to his own power or stature as governor of Judah, but to God’s stature. Nehemiah followed this admonition by setting a powerful example himself. He admited that he and his closest confederates have also leant money and grain. He did not say that he and his confederates were charging interest or imposing debt slavery. He did say that they would forgive and erase all of the loans. Nehemiah acted sacrificially to set the right example. Micah 6: 6-8 says, “(6) With what shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? (7) Will the LORD be pleased with[a] thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?” (8) He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” By this sacrificial gesture, Nehemiah exhibits God’s justice and loving kindness; and he models humility in his walk with the Lord. It is only after setting this example, and acting with utter integrity and honesty that Nehemiah called on the nobles and officials to return ownership of all fields, vineyards, and houses, and to cease the interest charges that are approximately 12% a year. The crowd, called to respond in kind and in faithfulness, was uplifted and inspired. The nobles and officials promised to do all that Nehemiah had requested. Having achieved this public agreement, Nehemiah was open and public in setting an abiding example of God’s generosity in his own life. Question: How does he do this? In verse 14, Nehemiah tells us that he served as governor of Judah for twelve years, from 445 B.C. to 433 B.C. He had real power for a long term. He had the right to certain privileges, gathered at the expense of the people; privileges that all Persian governors in all provinces took. One of these was a food allowance. Nehemiah tells us that he and his fellow administrators never claimed this during their term. In addition to collecting taxes for the central treasury, the king’s treasury, each provincial governor was entitled to collect for his own needs and his own personal treasury. Nehemiah tells us that his predecessors had historically exacted a heavy toll from the people in food, wine, and currency. Even lesser administrators, ‘servants’, had been permitted to do this. Nehemiah did not continue this practice because of his reverential “fear of the Lord. In verse 16 he tells us that his focus was on rebuilding the Jerusalem wall, and he never engaged in any speculation, primarily land speculation, that would have added to his personal wealth. As governor this temptation and opportunity was constantly available to him. As governor, he was required to set an extensive table each day, receiving and feeding as many as 150 officials, dignitaries from surrounding nations, and other visitors. He paid for all of this out of his own pocket for 12 years. At the end of this passage, Nehemiah asks God to remember him with favor for all that he has done for the people. This may sound self-aggrandizing but it’s not. Nehemiah is asking that God establish the value of his service, and that God accept his faithfulness. He is not asking for wealth, power, fame, immortality, or the destruction of his enemies. D. L. Moody wrote, “A holy life will produce the deepest impression. Lighthouses blow no horns; they only shine.” Nehemiah shines. Warren Wiersbe (Be Determined) writes that chapter 5 teaches us four important things: First, problems will arise among the people we lead or work with, no matter how noble the enterprise, how well-intended the efforts, and regardless of whether we share the same faith. Second, God calls on us to address these problems with his courage, his counsel, his restraint, his valuing of other lives and voices, and his honesty and encouragement. Third, we must act with God’s integrity as we strive to help solve the problems and challenges that arise. This requires sacrifice, vigilance, self-reflection, continuous prayer, and keeping God at the center of everything. Fourth, each problem, each challenge, each difficult or disappointing moment is an opportunity for God to work; to demonstrate his character, demonstrate his presence in the world, and demonstrate his faithful lovingkindness, mercy, and divine wisdom.\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: 12,\n    date: '2016-05-15',\n    path: '6+1-19',\n    title: 'renewed assault from without and within: and a wall built ',\n    book: 'Nehemiah',\n    label: 'Nehemiah',\n    verse: 'Nehemiah 6:1-19',\n    chapterFrom: 6,\n    verseFrom: 1,\n    chapterTo: 6,\n    verseTo: 19,\n    image: 'https://davyjonesdesign.github.io/data-for-axios/assets/wmstudies/nehemiah.jpg',\n    paragraph1: 'As Nehemiah deals with the speculative, advantage taking behavior of his own people, while fighting to keep focus on the completion of the wall, his external enemies renew their creative efforts to derail the project.

His trust enables him to respond to Sanballat, in verse 8, with with fearless honesty and clarity, “What you say is not happening and you are making it up.” Nehemiah knows that Sanballat’s goal is to disrupt the last work in finishing the walls and gates. At the end of verse 9 Nehemiah returns again to God and asks him to strengthen his hands. The second challenge Nehemiah faces in chapter 6 is even more dangerous because it comes from inside; from the exiled Jews themselves. Nehemiah goes to visit Shemaiah who was most likely a priest, since he had ready access to the temple. Question: What is the danger and what is Nehemiah’s reaction? Shemaiah was a Jew and someone that Nehemiah knew, at least fairly well, because he’s visiting him at home. Shemaiah might have been isolated at home because he was unclean, but this would make no sense in light of his suggestion that they enter the temple together. The home isolation was probably self-imposed as a dramatic gesture of prophetic contemplation, or demonstration that Shemaiah feared for his own life. It was also a clever way to get Nehemiah alone. Shemaiah presented his prophecy and solution in dramatic verse. “They are coming to kill you Nehemiah, they are coming to kill you in the night, so let’s go together and lock ourselves in the inner sanctuary of the temple where we will be safe.” With a straight face Shemaiah is suggesting that Nehemiah flee and hide in the temple sanctuary, where only priests are permitted to enter. For Nehemiah, who was not a priest, it would be a violation of Mosaic Law, punishable by death, to enter the temple sanctuary. The danger here is that Shemaiah is posing at both Nehemiah’s friend and an expert; someone who has Nehemiah’s best interests in mind and only wants to protect him. God had given Nehemiah the composure and discernment to see through this. To us Shemaiah’s antics seem stupid and unbelievable. But remember that Shemaiah was most likely a priest, and is presenting himself as a prophet, which would have given him considerable status and credibility. Nehemiah’s response to this is resolute, fearless, and clear, “Will a man like me take flight? Will I enter the sanctuary to stay alive? I will not go!” Nehemiah’s answer is twofold: he is a leader raised up by God and needs to set the right example even if it puts his life at risk, and he’s not a priest. He can’t break God’s law by entering the temple sanctuary. Nehemiah tells us that God gave him greater understanding once Shemaiah suggested that Nehemiah break the law. He then knew that Shemaiah was a false prophet in the service of Tobiah and Sanballat. Shemaiah’s deception means that there were individuals and families among the returned exiles who didn’t want Nehemiah to succeed. Nehemiah noted that the prophetess Nodiah and other prophets sought to make Nehemiah fearful enough to abandon his mission. The opposition Nehemiah faced was extensive, well organized, and professional. They invited Nehemiah to stray far from Jerusalem, and then invited him into the very heart of his faith, the inner sanctuary of the temple. What is important for us to remember is that Nehemiah keeps his focus on God. He takes each challenge and temptation to God. He doesn’t lash out at Sanballat, Tobiah, Shemaiah, and Nodiah, he names them to God and asks God to deal with them. Because Nehemiah trusts God he has a true compass, anchor, and protection as he navigates these challenges. Again Paul understood this so well. In 2 Corinthians, chapter 10 he wrote, “(3) For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. (4) The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. (5) We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.” When the Jerusalem wall was completed in 52 days the significance was far greater than raised stone and doors hung at the gates. All the competing peoples who had claimed the Promised Land for themselves, the Samaritans, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the remnants of the Philistines all knew that something far greater had happened. God had intervened on behalf of his people to reassert their rightful place in the Promised Land. What is instructive for us is that even in this remarkable moment when God had so clearly demonstrated both his presence and merciful intervention, Jewish nobles were still maneuvering by exchanging letters with the malignant Tobiah, and then trying to convince Nehemiah of Tobiah’s good deeds. Again Nehemiah saws through this and recognized that Tobiah was using this exchange of letters as another way of instilling fear, doubt, and distraction. The Lord is Nehemiah’s rock and purpose: Psalm 32 says, “You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah (8) I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.” God gives us a stability and reassurance, and capacity to endure stress and conflict that transcends our own capabilities, and in turn grants us a wisdom and discernment that is far greater than the world could ever muster. Under the new covenant this is the gift of the Holy Spirit.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 13,\n    date: '2016-05-22',\n    path: '7+1-73',\n    title: 'bridge of names, a distinct people',\n    book: 'Nehemiah',\n    label: 'Nehemiah',\n    verse: 'Nehemiah 7:1-73',\n    chapterFrom: 7,\n    verseFrom: 1,\n    chapterTo: 7,\n    verseTo: 73,\n    image: 'https://davyjonesdesign.github.io/data-for-axios/assets/wmstudies/nehemiah.jpg',\n    paragraph1: 'At the beginning of chapter 7, two administrators, with similar names, Hanani and Hananiah , are appointed over Jerusalem  for the first time since the exiles have returned.

Do not mourn or weep….Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.” This is remarkable. Amidst conviction God planted exceeding joy and part of the gift of worship was the open and extended expression of that joy. Psalm 100 says, “Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth.

Scholars generally agree that the book of Esther was written sometime between 500 and 330 BC. Authorship is unknown but, by the examination of the language, it is assumed that the author was someone living in exile. The events in Esther occur about 66 years after Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, issued his decree in 539 BC, allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem, but as Karen H.Jobes notes in her commentary, Esther (The NIV Application Commentary), book of Esther does not mention of Jerusalem or the temple. Jobes and Iain M.Duguid (Esther & Ruth, Reformed Expository Commentary) both note that compared to the book of Daniel, which is also set in the court of a pagan king, no one offers a prayer in the book of Esther. There are no apocalyptic visions, no evident concern for the Law, and no obvious miracles. Jobes writes, “Because of the absence of religious values and the presence of sensuality and brutality, the book of Esther has posed a problem for interpreters throughout its history. For the first seven centuries of the Christian church, not one commentary was produced on this book. As far as we know, John Calvin never preached from Esther nor did he include it among his commentaries. Martine Luther denounced this book together with the apocryphal 2 Maccabees, saying of them, “I am so great an enemy to the second book of Maccabees, and to Esther, that I wish they had not come to us at all, for they have too many heathen unnaturalities.” On the other hand, Moses Maimonides, the great 12th century Jewish philosopher, ranked it equal to the Pentateuch: “When Messiah comes, the other books…may pass away, but the Torah and Esther will abide forever.” Maimonides may have been thinking that just as God’s Law (as expressed in the Torah) will stand forever so too does his promise to deliver God’s people , illustrated with compelling power by the story of Esther.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 16,\n    date: '2015-09-20',\n    path: 'history',\n    title: 'history',\n    book: 'esther',\n    label: 'Esther',\n    verse: 'Esther',\n    chapterFrom: '',\n    chapterTo: '',\n    verseFrom: '',\n    verseTo: '',\n    image: 'https://davyjonesdesign.github.io/data-for-axios/assets/wmstudies/esther.jpg',\n    paragraph1: 'The story of Ruth occurred during the time of Judges around 1100 BC.

In these verses there is a lesson for us about in the true nature of anti-Semitism and the hatred of God in Haman’s actions that we should remember in dealing with enemies of Christ and God.

Haman’s hatred is purely against God’s chosen people but he changes his approach for Xerxes to sound more reasonable, claiming that the Jews, not as individuals, but as a people, are disobeying the king’s law and are enemies of the state. The accusations are vague and broad and made in private. He appeals to the king’s interest and to the potential of vast economic gain to get the king’s permission and he promises to carry out the massacre himself so that the king doesn’t feel a sense of direct involvement. Haman uses the power of the king and the power of the state to give legitimacy to mass murder and wrongdoing. Haman uses his office and authority to involve many others in his plot.

After putting all of this in motion, verse 15 tells us that Haman sits down to have a celebratory drink. By comparison, the people of the city of Susa itself are bewildered by this blood-thirsty edict. There are those who hate God, hate his people, Jew or Christian, and will do or say anything to discredit them. Sometimes these are people we would hold in high esteem because of their success, intelligence, or power. We must be vigilant and wise in discerning their intentions. This is also terrifying.

Indeed, we see, at the beginning of chapter 4, the deep grief, mourning, and fear of Mordecai and all the Jewish people in Persia as news of the new law travels. But God is present, even in utter bleakness and the ruthless power of a godless state. King Darius himself, not a believer, testified to the true power of God after witnessing Daniel’s example and deliverance in Daniel, chapter 6: “(25) Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth: “May you prosper greatly!

She is kept apart from the king for long stretches of time, and purposefully shielded from news of the world around her. Esther did not know about Haman’s well publicized edict commanding extermination of the Jews until Mordecai shared it with her through the court eunuch Hathatch. Esther’s life is defined by leisure, banquets, the excessive drinking that the Persian’s  loved, and a complete lack of privacy as she lived out her life in the presence of a host of servants; some spying on behalf of the king, and others spying on behalf of the king’s inner circle. The culture of Xerxes’ court was not designed to encourage the power and prestige of women but to minimize them. It would have been easy for Esther to be numbed by all this, and reduced to passive inaction, but she rises above the corrupting softness and indulgence, and risks all in the name of God and his chosen people. We see in her actions the reflection of David’s own journey and his words in Psalm 86, words Mordecai and Esther may have known :  ',\n    quote1: '(14) O God, arrogant men attack me;  a gang of ruthless men, who do not respect you, seek my life.

God is near him this night.',\n    paragraph2b: 'Remember that the chronicle is always updated in the king’s presence so the story it tells is designed to be flattering to the king.

He is startled afresh by the account and wants to know immediately if Mordecai was ever rewarded. God has used this moment with exquisite timing. Xerxes is listening, open, sober, and there isn’t that vast noise of his court trying to influence him. He’s thinking about his own legacy and mortality as king, and the perfect opportunity arises for him to confirm his power, his largess and liberality, and to cement the loyal of one of his subjects by finally rewarding Mordecai.

She is kept apart from the king for long stretches of time, and purposefully shielded from news of the world around her. Esther did not know about Haman’s well publicized edict commanding extermination of the Jews until Mordecai shared it with her through the court eunuch Hathatch. Esther’s life is defined by leisure, banquets, the excessive drinking that the Persian’s loved, and a complete lack of privacy as she lived out her life in the presence of a host of servants; some spying on behalf of the king, and others spying on behalf of the king’s inner circle. The culture of Xerxes’ court was not designed to encourage the power and prestige of women but to minimize them. It would have been easy for Esther to be numbed by all this, and reduced to passive inaction, but she rises above the corrupting softness and indulgence, and risks all in the name of God and his chosen people. We see in her actions the reflection of David’s own journey and his words in Psalm 86, words Mordecai and Esther may have known: “(14) O God, arrogant men attack me; a gang of ruthless men, who do not respect you, seek my life. (15) But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God. You are patient and demonstrate great loyal love and faithfulness. (16) Turn toward me and have mercy on me! Give your servant your strength! Deliver your slave! (17) Show me evidence of your favor!” That night, after the first banquet, Xerxes’ cannot sleep, so he has the chronicles of his reign read to him. This is a poignant moment. You can almost hear Xerxes’ longing for significance and affirmation in commanding this reading: ‘Have I been a good king? Will I be remembered?’ In Xerxes we see earthly power without God. Even this only leads to corruption, decay, and death. Xerxes has a sense of this however brief. God is near him this night. Remember that the chronicle is always updated in the king’s presence so the story it tells is designed to be flattering to the king. Xerxes commands the attendants to read, going back at least five years before, because the record recounts the saving service done by Mordecai in disclosing the plan by Bigthana and Teresh, two of Xerxes’ trusted guards, to assassinate him. He is startled afresh by the account and wants to know immediately if Mordecai was ever rewarded. God has used this moment with exquisite timing. Xerxes is listening, open, sober, and there isn’t that vast noise of his court trying to influence him. He’s thinking about his own legacy and mortality as king, and the perfect opportunity arises for him to confirm his power, his largess and liberality, and to cement the loyal of one of his subjects by finally rewarding Mordecai. It’s the sort of impulsive behavior we have seen repeatedly in Xerxes, but this time God uses that character flaw to accomplish his specific purposes. Question: This is a pivotal moment that begins the decisive shift of power and influence away from Haman and to Esther, Mordecai and the Jews. What does this teach us? God can reach anyone at any time. He is not subject to our schedules or limited imaginations. In this moment of great influence, Xerxes is about alone as he ever is, trying to sleep and failing. There are no state dinners, no formal meetings, no phalanx of advisors, or intricate plots. There is a king in his sleeping attire reminded of the extraordinary good service rendered by one of God’s people five years before. Nor does God need for Xerxes’ to suddenly become godly, good, or wise; he uses Xerxes’ own nature to accomplish his greater purpose which is to bring attention to Mordecai and Mordecai’s faithfulness which will help lead to deliverance for the exiled Jews. The works we, as believers, do in God’s name never go to waste. Sometimes we think God is not listening or that we have failed because we don’t get the effect or result we long for, at the moment we want it. God’s view is much longer than ours. When Mordecai saved the king from assassination and received no recognition in return, and then had to watch Haman’s elevation, he must have felt that God was ignoring him and the complete lack of any justice for his faithfulness. Five years later God directs Xerxes’ sleepy mind to Mordecai’s service and the result is far more powerful and useful than anything Mordecai could have imagined or wanted. Our confidence should first be in God and not our own design. The Book of Esther is thick with plotting, maneuvering, and state craft but neither Mordecai nor Esther could have predicted or engineered the outcome that God brought about. We should not take God’s intervention for granted or lightly assume that we may predict it. We need to seek him with faithfulness, persistence, and humility and should not be put off by the doubts or dry times that will certainly occur. Christ gave us the model for this in the parable of the persistent widow in Luke 18:1-8: “Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart. (2) He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people. (3) There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ (4) For a while he refused, but later on he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people, (5) yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas.’” (6) And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says! (7) Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them? (8) I tell you, he will give them justice speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”The widow is not presented in an endearing way and the judge despises her and ignores her as long as he can. Yet, said God, I listen, respond, and dispense mercy to you who believe in me in moments just like these, and with a motive driven by my love for you; don’t abandon your faith. Isaiah 55: 3, 4 & 6-9 capture God’s greater design in God’s own voice with startling power: “Pay attention and come to me! Listen, so you can live! Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you, just like the reliable covenantal promises I made to David. (4) Look, I made him a witness to nations, a ruler and commander of nations….(6) Seek the LORD while he makes himself available; call to him while he is nearby! (7) The wicked need to abandon their lifestyle and sinful people their plans. They should return to the LORD, and he will show mercy to them, and to their God, for he will freely forgive them. (8) “Indeed, my plans are not like your plans, and my deeds are not like your deeds, (9) for just as the sky is higher than the earth, so my deeds are superior to your deeds and my plans superior to your plans.” Ironically Haman cannot wait to have Mordecai impaled, so is waiting to see Xerxes’ at the crack of dawn. He has already authorized construction of the gallows. Question: What do we need to understand about the true character of the wicked? Psalm 36: 1-4 gives us extraordinary insight. It’s written by David and it reflects a revelation that God gave David concerning the true character of the wicked: “(1) An evil man is rebellious to the core. He does not fear God, (2) for he is too proud to recognize and give up his sin. (3) The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful; he does not care about doing what is wise and right. (4) He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed; he is committed to a sinful lifestyle; he does not reject what is evil.” This is a perfect rendering of Haman’s character and heart. He is obsessed with his power and with doing harm to those who don’t fear or respect it. He hates the Israelites because, as God’s chosen people, they are his hereditary enemies, and he has committed his full influence and resources to destroying them. He literally can’t wait to do the next bad thing. Evil drive him. What is the answer to the formidable and active impulse of the wicked to do harm and to slander the name of God? David also supplies the answer in Psalm 36:5-10: “O LORD, your loyal love reaches to the sky; your faithfulness to the clouds. (6) Your justice is like the highest mountains, your fairness like the deepest sea; you preserve mankind and the animal kingdom. (7) How precious is your loyal love, O God! The human race finds shelter under your wings. (8) They are filled with food from your house, and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies.

Haman’s own design becomes his undoing.'\n      }\n    ],\n    content: 'While Haman is reeling from a punctured ego he is summoned to attend the second banquet set up by Queen Esther. Esther must now share her request with Xerxes in front of Haman. Remember that Esther’s circumstances have not changed. She has not been given greater freedom, or unlimited access to the king, or greater status; she has not been allowed to emerge from the managed isolation of her quarters. She does not know that Xerxes has had a sleepless night, and may not even know that Xerxes has forced Haman to honor Mordecai. As far as she knows Haman is as powerful as ever. It is remarkable that she has included Haman at the banquet. It would have been easier for Esther to have asked to speak to the king alone, outside of Haman’s presence, just as Haman sought to speak to Xerxes alone when he wanted to kill Mordecai. What Esther knows is that she has one moment in which to attempt to influence the king. Her courage, steadiness, humility, and wisdom are extraordinary; and a model for us in learning servant leadership. Question: Just as we see the absence of God in Haman’s character, we see the presence of God in Esther’s character. What evidence do we see in chapter 7? Esther’s beginning language, as she makes her petition, is gentle and modest. She does not assert her identity or privilege as queen. Xerxes is a giant jerk, an impulsive cad, and a megalomaniac but Esther addresses him with profound respect and deference, just like Daniel did, and Joseph did. Her words are all about how the king feels, “If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases your majesty, grant me my life -- this is my petition.” Esther is also fearless in identifying herself personally with the request. Her opening words proclaim, “Xerxes if you don’t grant this then I will die too.” Esther’s language is plain and truthful. In verse 4 her description of the deed to come “For I and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation…” mirrors the language of the decree drawn by Haman himself in Esther 3:13. Haman, who is sitting there, cannot object, because Esther is essentially quoting him. She also frames the dire nature of the situation for Xerxes, saying, ‘if this weren’t such a horrible thing, if it was only about further enslavement, I would not bother you with this.’ Notice too that Esther does not jump the gun. She does not start with accusation; she starts with an even-handed description of the issue; just like the prophet Nathan, when he confronted David about Bathsheba. Esther also demonstrates that she is a great leader. In this moment she is the Queen of her exiled people and has taken up their cause, at the highest level, when no one else can. God has indeed appointed her for this moment. We see Xerxes at full impulse. He has no recollection of the decree he’s signed against the Jews and demands to know “where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?” We see several things here. Xerxes demonstrates the historic tendency of all autocrats to not take responsibility for their actions. He gave Haman his signet ring and his authorization but that is now conveniently forgotten. Also, kings, whether good or bad, tend to be notoriously busy and move on from past decisions to the next thing. Esther recognizes all this in how she frames her request. Esther is observing the admonition found in Ephesians 4:29, “Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.” Remarkably, even as she makes her petition, Esther is also giving grace to Xerxes. We also see something akin to the Holy Spirit at work in Esther, reflecting what Paul wrote in I Corinthians 12:7-9, “(7) The Holy Spirit is given to each of us in a special way. That is for the good of all. (8) To some people the Spirit gives a message of wisdom. To others the same Spirit gives a message of knowledge. (9) To others the same Spirit gives faith.” We clearly see God at work in Esther, and Esther’s character becomes like God’s. She speaks with an inspiration, temperance, and self-abnegation that is beyond the reach of human action, and clearly within the realm of God. The rest of chapter 7 is dark. Esther accuses Haman – “the adversary and the enemy is this vile Haman” - and Xerxes has him executed on the very seven story gallows that Haman built for Mordecai. Question: Some commentators say that Esther should have exercised more charity and mercy here, rather than accomplishing Haman’s execution. Do you agree? Remember that Esther, like Mordecai, is from the tribe of Benjamin, which was also the tribe of King Saul, and that Saul lost his right of kingship because he disobeyed God’s command, shared through the prophet Samuel, to attack and exterminate the Amalekites and their king, Agag, who were devout enemies of Israel. Now a second monarch from the tribe of Benjamin faces a blood descendant of the Amalekites, whose evil malice in the service of Xerxes and threat to annihilate the exiled Jewish population is directly traceable to Saul’s disobedience. Esther will not make the same mistake. Haman is not repentant or regretful; verse 6 tells us that he was terrified and undone that Xerxes had turned against him. He begs Esther for his life, not for forgiveness. God knows Haman’s heart and is administering the justice that Haman deserves. As Paul wrote in Galatians 6: 7-8, “Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. 8 For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.” Remember that Haman still wears the king’s signet ring and carries the power of Xerxes wherever he goes. Given Xerxes’ distracted state, Haman could have fomented rebellion against Xerxes himself and then fulfilled his plan to exterminate the Jews. Esther cannot allow that possibility. In addition, the only way to counteract the original edict of extermination was to create a new edict that granted the Jews a greater right of self-defense that the original right to exterminate them. Haman’s power, which is in the service of evil, must end. Throughout scripture God makes clear that the wicked will receive his justice. Psalm 147: 5-6 says, “Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure. (6) The LORD lifts up the humble; he casts the wicked to the ground” Haman is literally clutching at Esther to beg for his life. When Xerxes returns from the palace garden he assumes that Haman is trying to rape Esther. By law no one was ever to be closer than seven steps from the king’s concubines. This would include the queen. This becomes the grounds for Xerxes’ first charge against Haman. The second charge arises when the eunuch Harbona notes that the 75 foot tall gallows was constructed by Haman to kill Mordecai, who has become a benefactor and favorite of the king. Plotting to kill Mordecai, now under the king’s protection, becomes treason and seals Haman’s execution. Haman’s own design becomes his undoing.

We don’t know.',\n    content: 'We get a strong sense of the division and volatility within the Persian Empire by the reaction to the two edicts. There is still a strong element across many of the 127 provinces that is committed to attacking the Jews despite the issuance of the second decree and the fall of Haman. These are probably allies who remain true to the power of Haman’s household, opportunists who want to seize additional wealth (plunder), and those who view this war of competing edicts as a referendum on the power of Xerxes and Mordecai. At this point in his reign Xerxes is not beloved by his people. His failed expeditions against the Greeks have resulted in catastrophic casualties, huge investments, near bankruptcy, and much higher taxes. Question: Are the Jews excessive or vindictive in their response? Although there is some fuzziness in the language it is most likely that the Jews are attacking only those who attack them first. The enemies arrayed against the Jews are seeking not simply to defeat or embarrass them, but to wipe them from the face of the earth. Part of the Jewish response is to simply ensure that the people seeking their annihilation aren’t around to do it again. Part of this battle is completing the holy war against the Amalekites; and in aid of this they kill the 10 sons of Haman who have taken up arms against them. Queen Esther requests that their dead bodies be put on public display (9:13) just like the bodies of King Saul and his sons were put on display by the Philistines at Beth-Shan. Esther’s request to extend the edict for one more day may seem blood thirsty or punitive but it’s really not. Many commentators view this as excessive vengeance or the triumph of blood lust but there are practical reasons for Esther to make her request. There is a pitched battle going on across the 127 provinces of the empire, and it will take more than one day to resolve. What is unspoken here is that the Jews must have suffered losses as well, even though permitted to take up arms in self-defense, and even though they have the support of Xerxes’ nobles, satraps, governor, and administrators. This is a messy moment and we can imagine that the enemies of the Jews are fighting as hard as they can to achieve the results promised in the first edict, and not the second. As Warren Wiersbe writes (Be Committed: Doing God’s Will Whatever the Cost, David C. Cook, 1993, p. 180, “The fear of God protects those who fear God and believe His promises. Because the Jews believed Mordecai’s decree, they had new courage and were not afraid of the enemy, and their courage put fear into the hearts of the enemy.” Esther’s own actions state her confidence in God’s outworking in her world. Perhaps she is remembering verses from Psalm 22: “(29) All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you. (28) For kingship belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations.” Book of Esther: A Hard Victory and a Profound Remembrance. Haman and Xerxes’ first edict and the second correcting edict allowing the Jews to gather and defend themselves have resulted in a small scale war. Verse 16 of chapter 9 tells us that at the end of the fighting across the 127 provinces the Jews have killed 75,000 Persians in defending themselves. This does not count wounded or captured or calculate the number of Jews killed and wounded. This casualty level states a much larger number of Persians who joined in the attack against the Jews. It means that the Jews, in defending themselves, and even in having the help of the king’s administration, may still have been outnumbered in many instances. They fought across a vast territory and amidst a large foreign population mostly ambivalent and probably often unwilling to assist them. To frame this, Guinness world records says that 49 million of the world’s estimated 112 million people lived in the Persian Empire in 480 BC. Keep in mind that God does not deliver the Jews from conflict, but does enable them to enter the conflict and overcome. Verses 15 and 16 also tells us that the Jews in Susa, and the Jews in the 127 provinces, did not take any plunder from those they defeated. To not take the property of the defeated was to behave differently than every other people, nation, or culture at this time in history. Plunder was the accepted right of the victor, and a sensible practice at a time when resources were scarce and survival from year to year was a high risk proposition. Under the second edict the Jews were granted the right to take the property of those who attacked them. Question: What does this refusal to take plunder tell us? This is affirmative proof that the Jews had not forgotten God; and that the Book of Esther does not simply offer a recounting of secular events. It is very similar to Abraham’s decision to not take plunder after defeating Kedorlaomer and three other kings in rescuing Lot. In Genesis 14:22 Abram said, “I have raised my hand to the LORD. God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, and have taken an oath that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or a thong of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’” After this fearless testimony, God comes to Abram in a vision, in Genesis 15:1, and says, “Don’t be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, and your great reward.” So, by their actions rather than spoken words, the Jews were announcing to everyone around them that they looked to God and acknowledged him as the source of their deliverance and provision. They were expressing their confidence, that even in exile, God was with them and had not abandoned them. This decisive act of faith must have spooked the Persians. It affirmed God’s view that this was a holy war, and not a regional conflict. It had further symbolism in correcting Saul’s error, long before the reign of Xerxes and the time of exile, in keeping plunder from the Amalekites when God told him not to. Following this conflict, and their deliverance the Jews paused and celebrated. In rural villages the conflict ended sooner than in the cities so the celebrations crossed over several days. What is interesting is that the Jews celebrated on their own. This was not commanded by God but was very much in keeping with his character in remembering and celebrating great moments of God’s faithfulness such as Passover. Mordecai observed this celebration and then formalized it in verses 20-22, with a letter sent to all the provinces, directing that all Jews celebrate this occasion each year, on the 14th and 15th day of Adar. This celebration became Purim, meaning ‘lot’ referencing Haman’s roll of the dice in Esther 3:7 to determine the day, month, and year in which the Jews were to be massacred. Verse 29 tells us that Esther and Mordecai, together, write, with full authority, a second letter, confirming that Purim would always be celebrated as Mordecai directed in the first letter. This letter is described in verse 30 as “words of peace and truth. Question: What is the significance of Purim and what do we, as followers of Christ, learn from the Book of Esther? God uses the common, the ordinary, the imperfect, the dispossessed, the exiled, the weak, the poor, the endangered, the beleaguered, and the oppressed to accomplish his great and majestic purposes. This cannot be emphasized too strongly or repeated too often. Esther had great beauty and Mordecai was a low level court official but they did not have wealth, preference, or distinction in the Persian Empire. They were exiles, with no rights, subject to the rule of a vast empire. God uses this approach so often because the weak have no delusions about where deliverance and salvation come from. Think of Mordecai’s raw lament and unembarrassed display of weeping, sack cloth, and ashes. If we saw him coming down the street we would cross to the other side.

From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.” We must join Esther and Mordecai in looking up to God. Reach out to him when you are at lowest ebb. He will take hold and not let go. God enters history, he enters our daily lives, he enters into places that we view as dark and forbidden, nothing withstands him. The term ‘Purim’ really tells us that God’s power, and providential care for his people are greater than Haman’s power and greater than his cold casting of the dice. In Isaiah 45 God says “I am the LORD, and there is no other. I form the light and create darkness; I bring prosperity and create disaster. I, the LORD, do all these things” During the Holocaust Jews took great care to preserve and share the text of Esther; and to remember God’s actions in saving his people from extinction. Women stand equally with men before God and Christ; and God uses them powerfully in leading and accomplishing his work. God elevates Esther to a position of power and uses her to accomplish his greater purpose by making her a superlative, if flawed leader. By the end of chapter 9 Esther is called Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, signifying that God has brought her to full maturity as both queen of Persia and queen of her people, the chosen people of God.

She kept God’s instruction in Isaiah 41:10, “So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” Faith begins with each individual but is grounded in the community of believers in Christ, which today is the Church. Esther and Mordecai worked together to address the challenges they faced. They didn’t abandon one another, resent one another, or betray one another. Esther put Mordecai forward at risk to her own reputation, and Mordecai was steadfast in putting his people first, and not seeking his own preferment. Mordecai also kept Esther informed when she had no other sources of outside information and reminded her of God’s greater purposes for her at the critical moment. Finally Esther reminds us that even when everything around us seems to degrade, devalue, mock, and override our very faith, and the very presence of God, He is still there, and we are his chosen people; inhabited by his divine majesty, mercy, wisdom, power, love, and grace. We may travel dark paths in the world but we are set apart as his children of light. As Peter wrote in I Peter 2:9 “But you are a chosen people a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.” This is our identity in life and in death; and in the great eternal life to come. So the end is not the end. The deliverance for the Jews occurred in 473 B.C. and Xerxes reign continued until August 465 B.C., eight years later, when Xerxes and his son Darius were assassinated by Artabanus, the leader of the king’s body guard, with the help of a eunuch named Aspamitres. Artaxerxes, the third son of Xerxes, seized power by killing Artabanus, and became the next king. In the Book of Ezra, Artaxerxes commissions Ezra, to take charge of Israel. Ezra returns to Israel in the seventh year of Artaxerxes’ reign. In the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign, Nehemiah is commissioned to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls of the city. We don’t know the rest of Esther’s fate or journey. Some say that she was the mother of Darius II who became king after Artaxerxes. Some say that Esther is the queen mentioned in Nehemiah 2:6, sitting beside Artaxerxes in the 20th year of his reign; when he commissions Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem. Some say she died when she was still young and others that she lived to an old age. We don’t know. What we do know is that her life did not end with Purim, nor did it become easy or idyllic. God did not deliver her from challenge, or the fantastic corruption of the Persian Empire; but he did walk with her in all her trials, he did give her a life of extraordinary significance, even if she could not see it completely at the time, he did give her an identity that aligned with His own character, enabling her to act in ways beyond her capacity, and he did give her a profound cause to rejoice, so great that it endures to this day. Today, with the same power, love, majesty, mercy, and conviction, He reaches out to us.

In the Old Testament prophets were usually physically present and standing before the very party or parties whom God intended them to address when they shared God’s truth and revelation. When Nathan the prophet confronted David about Bathsheba, he did it in David’s throne room (2 Samuel 12). Elijah physically confronted Ahab on the occasions when God used him to condemn Ahab, and in 2 Kings 9, Elisha the prophet sends a younger prophet to tell Jehu that Ahab’s household will be destroyed and that Jehu will be the next king of Israel.'\n      },\n      {\n        item: 'Scripture tells us that Jonah boarded a ship in Joppa which was located almost 30 miles due east of Jerusalem along the Mediterranean coastline.

In contrast, the port of entry and exit for the kingdom of Israel was the city of Dor, to the north of Joppa. Dor had been enlarged as a port by Solomon, and Dor, not Joppa, would have been Jonah’s logical location to leave by ship, and would have been easier and safer for Jonah to get to.

He sends a great wind across the sea, which has such violent and sudden power that it brings on a terrible storm and threatens to destroy the ship on which Jonah is making passage. Storms in the Mediterranean generally arise with suddenness and great intensity. The mention of a great moving wind and a mighty tempest in verse 4 suggest that God sent a cyclone. These weather patterns were often fatal for ancient ships which were shallow-bottomed compared to more modern vessels and powered by oars. In 255 BC, during the First Punic War, the Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their expeditionary army from Northern Africa after defeat by the Carthaginians. As this fleet was making its way back to Italy it sheltered at Sicily, and then continued to sail along Sicily’s southern coast. A sudden storm arose and destroyed the Roman fleet. Among a total of 464 warships, 384 were sunk in addition to 300 transports, drowning more than 100,000 men.'\n      },\n      {\n        item: 'Scripture tells us that the crew of Jonah’s ship was understandably afraid and each sailor cried out to his god, which gives us an insight into how active pagan worship was at this time in history and how integrated it was with culture, commerce, and everyday life. In Roman times it was common for ship crews to hold ceremonies honoring their many gods before setting sail and a similar ceremony may have occurred on Jonah’s ship. In addition, in verse 5, we get a sense of the strength of the storm when the crew makes the decision to throw the ship’s entire cargo overboard to lighten the ship, and thus destroying the commercial value and purpose of their journey. Luke’s account in Acts 27 of Paul’s shipwreck as he sails to Italy gives excellent detail of what it was like to be caught by a storm in an ancient ship while on the open sea. '\n      },\n      {\n        bold: 'Verse 5 ',\n        item: 'also tells us that while the crew members were fighting for their lives Jonah had remained below deck and fallen into a deep sleep in much the same way Elijah slept in the wilderness after fleeing Jezebel. It is the sleep of escape and oblivion. Tim Keller writes that while the sailors were praying to their gods Jonah was not praying to his God. In fact he was not speaking to God at all. It is also a poignant illustration of the failure of God’s chosen people in the world. God had called on them to be his chosen and unique representatives in the world by modeling and sharing their faithfulness with pagan cultures. He had given Solomon vast means to reach these pagan cultures including a great fleet, built in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenicia, to bless the world and its people as God had promised Abraham. Now here is Jonah, shipboard, among pagan people who worship false gods, and he had broken his own communication with God, fled, and is in hiding down in the ship’s hold rather than using his relationship with and faith in God to rally and encourage the sailors as Paul did during his extended shipwreck in the Acts 27. As shared in verse 10 we learn that Jonah has been busy talking to the entire crew telling them that he is shipboard because he is fleeing the very God he worships. Compare Jonah to Paul in Acts 27. When the ship he is sailing in faces destruction Paul, who is a prisoner of Rome, is seemingly fearless in testifying to his captors and the crew. Acts 27:21-26 says,',\n        quote: '21 Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. 22 Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. 23 For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, 24 and he said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.’ 25 So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. 26 But we must run aground on some island.'\n      },\n      {\n        bold: 'Paul’s active faith, and his powerful testimony on God’s behalf, to the pagan crew on his Roman ship, is what God wants for Jonah.

In the same way God uses the greater storm to arrest Jonah in his flight, he uses the footsteps of the captain from deck to below deck to confront Jonah. If we listen to the captain’s voice and language we hear God speaking to Jonah. The captain calls Jonah “you sleeper” indicating Jonah’s abandonment of his responsibility to both God and the ship’s crew. The captain tells Jonah to “arise” and pray to his god hoping that if enough gods are summoned one will pay attention and save the ship and its crew. “Arise” is exactly the same commanding language that God had used in verse 2 giving Jonah his mission to Nineveh, and this is clearly God saying to Jonah, “you need to start talking to me again. If you do I will respond.”'\n      },\n      {\n        bold: 'In verse 7',\n        item: ' the crew agreed to cast lots to determine who among the crew and its passengers had committed the evil that brought on the storm. Casting lots was a common practice in the ancient world, and there are examples in both the Old and New Testaments of this activity. For example, in Joshua 18:6, Joshua uses lots to determine the geographic inheritance, within the Promised Land, for seven of the Israelite tribes. In John 19:23-24, the Roman soldiers who crucified Jesus cast lots for his tunic. Proverbs 16:33 says, “The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord…,” meaning that when lots were cast by Jews and Christians in faith, before the arrival of Pentecost and the Holy Spirit, God would determine the outcome.

Again we see God’s hand in this interrogation because it reminds Jonah of exactly who he belongs to and who he is, how sacred and essential his relationship with God really is, and the cost of his disobedience. The crew asks, “On whose account has this evil come to us?  What is your occupation and where do you come from?

Unlike Paul, Jonah’s first sense of himself is as a citizen of the Kingdom of Israel, and not a citizen of God’s kingdom, and God’s emissary and prophet. Then Jonah is compelled by his own faith to confess to worshipping the LORD and that the LORD is the one true living God who has made the sea and the dry land and, by implication, has delivered them into the midst of this terrifying storm which God has created because of Jonah’s disobedience.

Be still!” And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 40 He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?” 41 And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”'\n      },\n      {\n        item: 'We can see the power of God’s effect on these men because when Jonah commands them, in verse 12, to throw him into the sea, they don’t want to do it, just as the centurion did not want to kill Paul, because of Paul’s powerful testimony and witness, and so saved all of the other prisoners as well as their ship wrecked.'\n      },\n      {\n        item: 'But in the case of Jonah, God’s storm is too great, implacable and fierce, and the ship’s crew, after rowing themselves to exhaustion, call out directly to God in verse 14, acknowledging God’s divine power in a way that Jonah has not, and then commit Jonah into the violent sea.'\n      }\n    ],\n    content: 'We have learned that Jonah was a man of faith, clearly valued by God and chosen by God to speak to Jeroboam II and his court as to God’s positive plans for Israel. Jonah has learned that God loves him and trusts him. Then why does Jonah run rather than relying on his relationship with God and talking to God as Moses did when God commanded Moses to go back to Egypt to release the Israelites from captivity? How is Jonah like us?  Have you ever felt so disappointed by God that you won’t speak to him? What do the means that God uses to pursue Jonah (the storm, the ship’s captain, and crew, and finally the fish) tells us about how God pursues us? Compare Jonah’s behavior in the storm to Paul’s behavior in Acts. What do we learn? Compare Jonah’s shipboard behavior during the storm to the crew’s behavior. How can God use others around us, even nonbelievers, in our lives? What we know from 2 Kings 14 is that Jonah is a man of faith and God’s prophet whom God has called to affirm the reign and success of King Jeroboam II to show the people of Israel that God still loves them and cherishes them and has not given up on them. Now, suddenly and with no warning or fanfare, God commands Jonah to “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it for their evil has come up before me.”  More than likely Jonah as never traveled farther than the distance from his home in Gath-helpher to King Jeroboam II’s place in the capital city of Samaria. When Jonah receives this command he is most likely in Samaria amongst his countrymen, enjoying the king’s favor and looking to the next communication from God and the next step in helping Israel to prosper and to return to God. God summons Jonah and commissions him for an entirely new prophetic assignment in the most radical way possible: Go to the most hostile, cruel, and dangerous people in the region who are also an ongoing threat to the very existence of Israel and its people; Go to Nineveh, Assyria’s biggest and greatest city; Travel 550 miles (which would take nearly a month) through their empire to get there; Preach against the Assyrians, without another human to support you, because God has taken note of their wickedness. Jonah objects. However he does not share his objections with God in the same way Moses did when God confronted him in the wilderness and commanded him to return to Egypt to release the Israelites from their Egyptian captivity (Exodus 3). Moses had a lengthy discussion with God and plainly enumerating his objections to God’s call:  I’m not qualified. I don’t have the answers and am not smart enough to figure them out. People won’t believe me. I am a truly terrible public speaker, please send anyone but me. Jonah had his own strong objections to God’s call to go to Nineveh but he does not share them at the outset other than by his actions: So great is Jonah’s distress that his immediate reaction in verse 3 is to remain silent and to run away from God and head for Tarshish. Jonah’s reaction is physical flight. His reaction is similar to Elijah’s flight into the wilderness when Jezebel threatened to kill him (1 Kings 19), except in this instance Jonah is not running away from another human being. He is running away from God.'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 32,\n    date: '2023-12-10',\n    path: 'chapter-2',\n    title: 'The Death of Jonah',\n    book: 'jonah',\n    label: 'Jonah',\n    verse: 'Jonah 2',\n    chapterFrom: '1',\n    verseFrom: '17',\n    chapterTo: '2',\n    verseTo: '10',\n    image: 'https://davyjonesdesign.github.io/data-for-axios/assets/wmstudies/jonah.jpg',\n    paragraph1: 'Read Jonah 1:17 and chapter 2, and Matthew 12:38-42.',\n    quest1: '',\n    list1: [\n      {\n        item: 'If God sent this storm for you like he sent it for Jonah how would you feel?'\n      },\n      {\n        item: 'What was Jonah most likely thinking about as the ship’s crew threw him into the water?'\n      },\n      {\n        item: 'How did the Jews regard the deep water?'\n      },\n      {\n        item: 'What is your own response to Jonah’s prayer?

This means that the last hands that handle him before his death are the unclean hands of pagans, the very people Jonah despises and doesn’t want to help, not his own Jewish countrymen. Kevin J. Youngblood (Jonah: Exegetical Commentary on the Old Testament, p. 84) writes that Jonah submits to being thrown overboard by the pagan crew because he now values himself as no better than the cargo the crew has already jettisoned. At this point, even though Jonah knows that the pagans have been actively praying to their gods, and that the one true living God whom Jonah worships is responsible for the storm, Jonah will still not talk to God.

His fellow Israelites will not have the chance to mourn his death, his body will not be prepared for burial in a tomb in the land of his own fathers. He will not lay in the earth of the Promised Land. For Jonah this would have been an unspeakable source of grief and loss, and in this moment he would have realized that his predicament was his own making. He had chosen to reject God, to distrust his own countrymen by not sharing his predicament with them, and to reject the Promised Land by leaving in secret.

God What does God think of Jonah? It is easy to assume that he finds Jonah as annoying as everyone else does. Fortunately we have God’s own eyewitness testimony. In Matthew 12:38-41 Christ says this about Jonah: 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.” 39 But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41 The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. In verse 39 Christ refers to Jonah as one of God’s prophets and in verse 41 he observes that the men of Nineveh repented specifically in response to Jonah’s preaching. Hebrews 1:1-2, says, “Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed to the heir of all things.” God loved and anointed his prophets to speak his truth to his people and the world before the arrival of Christ, and Jonah, by God’s own word and definition, stands in that prophetic lineage and beloved of God. And he was effective on God’s behalf. God regards Jonah as more precious, more important, more effective, and more beloved that Jonah regarded himself. God knew he could work with Jonah to help accomplish his greater purpose in the world. Today, reaching us through the redemptive power of Christ, God assigns a similar greater-than-life and abundant value to each of us and our capacity, in his name, to advance his kingdom.'\n  }\n];\n\nexport default studies;\n","import { ref } from 'vue';\nimport studiesData from '../data/studies.js';

Cost\",\n    author: 'Warren W. Wiersbe',\n    bookDescription: \"One was a foreigner and a peasant. The other, a reluctant queen to a man she hardly knew. But their stories have one thing in common: A remarkable faith committed to doing God's will. For both Ruth and Esther, God used stressful circumstances to bring about his eternal purposes. Ruth's commitment to the God of Naomi affected every generation to come, as she became an ancestor of King David and more importantly, Jesus Christ. Esther's obedience led to the preservation of her people at a moment in history when all seemed lost.The stories of Ruth and Esther will make you contemplate: Would I trust God enough to do what they did? Go chapter by chapter through the books of Ruth and Esther to see how the lives of these two remarkable women epitomize the type of faith that glorifies God. As you read, ask yourself: How does God want to use my faithful commitment? Will he use your life to affect the generations to come, or will he use your life to impact the current generation? Either way, author Warren Wiersbe helps you to be prepared and be committed to God's will no matter what the cost.\",\n    bookLink: 'https://www.google.com/books/edition/Be_Committed_Ruth_Esther/DQJL1jYmDHkC?hl=en&kptab=overview&gbpv=0'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    label: 'Nehemiah',\n    bookImg: 'https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bn-C5JJI_YoC&pg=PP1&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&bul=1&sig=ACfU3U1ozVHemmYEFKxk4REf_i6Ro5ZcYA&w=1280',\n    title: 'Be Determined: Standing Firm in the Face of Opposition',\n    author: 'Warren W.

Esther is perfect inspiration for us when we find ourselves in situations we never sought, never planned for, and don’t think we have the gifts to succeed at.

France's masterful commentary on Matthew focuses on exegesis of Matthew's text as it stands rather than on the prehistory of the material or details of Synoptic comparison. It is concerned throughout with what Matthew himself meant to convey about Jesus and how he set about doing so within the cultural and historical context of first-century Palestine. Amid the wide array of Matthew commentaries available today, France's world-class stature, his clear focus on Matthew and Jesus, his careful methodology, and his user-friendly style promise to make this volume an enduring standard for years to come.\",\n    bookLink: 'https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Gospel_of_Matthew/0ruP6J_XPCEC?hl=en&gbpv=0'\n  },\n  {\n    id: 6,\n    label: 'Matthew',\n    bookImg: 'https://books.google.com/books/content?id=zcVVp_YD4w4C&pg=PP1&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&bul=1&sig=ACfU3U2oEFIGPk9PZ-aqW8Rcnt-90lX7IA&w=1280',\n    title: 'Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony',\n    author: 'Richard Bauckham',\n    bookDescription: 'This momentous book argues that the four Gospels are closely based on the eyewitness testimony of those who personally knew Jesus.
